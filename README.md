# Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science Internship.

## Project 1: Credit Risk Prediction 🏦
### Objective
To build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not.

### Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values in `Gender`, `Married`, and `LoanAmount` using Mode and Median imputation.
2. **EDA:** Visualized the distribution of Loan Amount and the impact of Education on Loan Status.
3. **Preprocessing:** Converted categorical variables into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.
4. **Modeling:** Trained a **Logistic Regression** model.

### Results
- **Accuracy:** ~79%
- **Key Insight:** Applicants with a "Credit History" of 1 are significantly more likely to get a loan approved.
- **Evaluation:** The Confusion Matrix indicates the model performs well in identifying successful applicants.
