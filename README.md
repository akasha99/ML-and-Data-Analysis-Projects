## 📌 Featured Projects

### 1. Credit Risk Prediction Model
- **Business Problem:** Automating the loan approval process to minimize financial risk for a lending institution.
- **Technical Solution:** Developed a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression** to predict loan defaults with an accuracy of **~79%**. Key focus on data cleaning and feature analysis.

### 2. Medical Insurance Cost Estimator
- **Business Problem:** Predicting medical insurance costs to enable data-driven pricing and accurate risk assessment for new clients.
- **Technical Solution:** Engineered an optimized **Random Forest Regressor** with interaction features. This approach **reduced prediction error (MAE) by ~40%** compared to a baseline linear model.

- ### 3. [Bank Customer Churn Analytics](./Project-Bank-Customer-Churn/)
*   **Domain:** Banking / Customer Success
*   **Solution:** Developed a churn prediction engine to identify at-risk customers.
*   **Core Skills:** Categorical Encoding, Feature Importance Analysis, Standardized Scaling, Random Forest Classification.
