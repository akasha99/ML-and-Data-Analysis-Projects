# Project 4: Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis 🌸

## 📌 Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the cornerstone of any data science workflow. This project focuses on the statistical exploration and visualization of the **Iris Dataset**, a classic multi-class dataset used extensively in pattern recognition and morphological analysis.

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand the underlying structure and statistical properties of the dataset.
- Implement multivariate visualizations to identify species clusters.
- Detect outliers and analyze feature distributions using statistical plots.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Visualizations
1. **Data Inspection:** Verified data integrity and performed central tendency analysis.
2. **Scatter Plots:** Analyzed the relationship between sepal dimensions, revealing the degree of overlap between species.
3. **Histograms & KDE:** Examined the distribution density of petal lengths.
4. **Box Plots:** Leveraged box-and-whisker plots to identify the spread of petal widths and detect statistical outliers.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Iris Setosa** is statistically unique in its petal dimensions compared to *Versicolor* and *Virginica*.
- **Petal Width** and **Petal Length** are the most discriminative features for this dataset.
- No significant outliers were detected, indicating a very clean dataset for further modeling.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
